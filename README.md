# Element X Android (Neutrino)

P2P Fork of [Element X Android](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android), imported as a snapshot of `v26.05.2`.

Element X Android is a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) client built on the [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk), targeting devices running Android 7+. The UI layer is written using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), and the navigation is managed using [Appyx](https://github.com/bumble-tech/appyx).

## Rust SDK

Element X leverages the [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk) through an FFI layer that the final client can directly import and use.

## Minimum SDK version

Element X Android requires a minimum SDK version of 24 (Android 7.0, Nougat).

## Build instructions

Just clone the project and open it in Android Studio. Make sure to select the
`app` configuration when building (as we also have sample apps in the project).

To build against a local copy of the Rust SDK, see the [Developer
onboarding](docs/_developer_onboarding.md#building-the-sdk-locally) instructions.
